# Create Trello Task

Create a Trello task (card) using the Trello API.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- The user asks to create a Trello task/card
- The user wants to automate Trello card creation from notes or action items

## Prerequisites

Required environment variables:
- `TRELLO_API_KEY`
- `TRELLO_TOKEN`
- `TRELLO_LIST_ID`
- `TRELLO_BOARD_ID`
- `TRELLO_WORKSPACE_ID`

## Instructions

1. Confirm required environment variables are set.
2. Build a clear card title and optional description from user input.
3. Add useful context in the description when available (source, owner, or rationale).
4. Run the helper script:

```bash
create-trello-task.sh "Card title" --desc "Card description"
```

5. Share the created card URL with the user.
6. If API creation fails, show the error and ask whether to retry.

## Notes

- `TRELLO_LIST_ID` determines which list receives the card.
- The helper script validates that the list belongs to `TRELLO_BOARD_ID` and that the board belongs to `TRELLO_WORKSPACE_ID` before card creation.
