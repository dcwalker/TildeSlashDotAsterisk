# List PR Comments

Display all GitHub PR comments for the current branch's pull request in a readable format. This skill is for viewing comments only and does not take any action on them.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- The user wants to see or review PR comments
- The user asks to list, show, or display PR feedback
- You need to check what comments exist before deciding on action
- The user wants a summary of PR discussion

## Instructions

Review the script's help content by running `scripts/list-pr-comments.sh --help` to understand all available options.

Then, use the script to fetch and display all PR comments for this branch's PR:

```bash
scripts/list-pr-comments.sh
```

The script will display comments in a structured format showing:
- Comment ID and author
- Comment text
- File and line location
- Resolution status (resolved or unresolved)
- Any replies to the comment

### Filtering Options

The script supports various filtering options:

- Show only unresolved comments:
  ```bash
  scripts/list-pr-comments.sh --unresolved
  ```

- Show comments for a specific file:
  ```bash
  scripts/list-pr-comments.sh --file <filename>
  ```

- Show comments by a specific author:
  ```bash
  scripts/list-pr-comments.sh --author <username>
  ```

Consult the help output for the complete list of available options.

## Important Notes

- This skill is read-only and does not modify, reply to, or resolve any comments.
- For taking action on comments, use the address-pr-comments skill instead.
- The script requires the GitHub CLI (gh) to be installed and authenticated.
