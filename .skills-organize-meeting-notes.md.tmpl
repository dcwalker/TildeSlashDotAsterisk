# Organize Meeting Notes

Clean and organize raw meeting notes into a journal-ready Markdown format with this final order:
1. Meeting metadata
2. Attendees
3. Action items
4. Notes

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- The user asks to clean up, organize, or rewrite meeting notes
- The user wants notes converted into a personal journal format
- The user wants guided clarification of note significance before finalizing

## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Inputs

Collect:
- Meeting title/topic
- Start time
- End time
- Duration
- Location (optional)
- Attendee emails/names
- Raw notes text
- Any screenshots/photos and URLs

If required information is missing, ask for clarification. Do not guess.

### Step 2: Format Meeting Metadata

Format metadata exactly as:
- Meeting title/topic as `##` (H2)
- Remaining metadata on one line, fields separated by `•`
- Field order: `Start:`, `End:`, `Duration:`, `Location:` (only include location if provided)
- Keep labels (`Start:`, `End:`, `Duration:`, `Location:`) non-bold
- Bold only the values

Time correction rule:
- If end-start matches duration, keep end time as-is.
- If not, strikethrough only the original end time value and append corrected end time value (start + duration), both in the `End:` field.
- Example mismatch pattern:
  `Start: **Feb 27, 2025 at 11:00 AM** • End: ~~11:30 AM~~ **11:07 AM** • Duration: **7 minutes** • Location: **Home**`
- Example match pattern:
  `Start: **Feb 27, 2025 at 11:00 AM** • End: **11:30 AM** • Duration: **30 minutes**`

### Step 3: Format Attendees

Transform attendee emails:
- Email patterns: `<first>.<last>@...` or `<initial>.<last>@...`
- Convert to title case names
- Remove `-contractor` from names
- Sort alphabetically by first name
- Output as plain lines (no bullets, no extra formatting)

If only an initial is available and the full first name is unknown, ask the user before finalizing.

Ask the user who did not attend. After response:
- Apply strikethrough to invited names that did not attend.

### Step 4: Clean and Normalize Notes

Proofread notes for clarity and grammar without changing meaning.

Name rules in notes:
- Use attendee names as source of truth for spelling.
- First mention of each person: full name.
- Later mentions: first name only, unless multiple attendees share the same first name.

Acronym rule:
- Spell out acronyms on first use.

URL rule:
- If URLs are listed at the end of notes, move them into relevant note locations as Markdown hyperlinks.

Image rule:
- For each screenshot/photo, ask the user for significance.
- Add a caption under each image using either italic text or blockquote style.

### Step 5: Interview for Significance

For each note item:
- Ask one question at a time about significance.
- Wait for user response before the next question.
- Distill key points concisely.
- Ask for clarification when details are missing.
- Do not infer missing facts.
- When paraphrasing, always ask for confirmation.
- Avoid repetition and filler language.

### Step 6: Staged Approval Workflow

1. First, propose updates to:
   - Meeting Metadata
   - Attendees
   - Notes
2. Wait for user approval that these are good.
3. Then identify action items from notes.
4. Present action items draft for review.
5. Prompt user to confirm whether the action items are accurate.
6. It is valid for a meeting to have no action items. If none exist, explicitly confirm this with the user.
7. Once action items are confirmed, ask whether to create Trello tasks (one per action item).
8. If user says yes, create one Trello card per action item using `create-trello-task.sh`.
9. For each created Trello card, update the matching action item text to include a Markdown link to the card URL.
10. After Trello creation (or skip), produce final Markdown document.

### Step 7: Build Action Items

From notes, create action items as a simple checklist bullet list:
- Markdown format: `- [ ] ...`
- No sub-sections

Responsibility rewrite:
- If assignee is Dan Walker: write as a task Dan needs to complete.
- If assignee is anyone else: rewrite as a follow-up task Dan should do to confirm completion.

Action item validation and Trello creation:
- Ask: "Are these action items correct?" before finalizing.
- If confirmed and user wants Trello cards, run one command per action item:
  `create-trello-task.sh "<action item text>"`
- Include `--desc` for every Trello card with source context.
- Minimum required description context: meeting title plus meeting date/time.
- Preferred additional context: meeting topic and a short reason the action item exists.
- After each card is created, capture the returned card URL and replace that checklist item's text with a Markdown link to the card.
- Use format: `- [ ] [Action item text](https://trello.com/c/...)`
- If no action items are confirmed, skip Trello creation.

### Step 8: Final Output Format

When approved, return final Markdown with:
- Metadata block first (title + metadata line)
- Then `###### Attendees`
- Then `###### Notes`
- Then `###### Action Items`

If notes are significantly long:
- Add a concise italicized summary at the top.

At the very end, append:
- `#### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM: <Meeting Title>`
- Use 24-hour time.

## Quality Rules

- Keep output concise and readable.
- Preserve factual accuracy; do not invent details.
- Ask clarifying questions when uncertain.
- Follow requested section order and formatting exactly.
