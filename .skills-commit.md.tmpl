# Commit

Create a commit following project standards, ensuring all changes are intentional, complete, and properly documented.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- The user asks to commit changes
- You need to commit code changes following project conventions
- You need to create a properly formatted commit message

## Instructions

Please start by reviewing the AGENTS.md then the "Commit Messages" section of the CONTRIBUTING.md document before proceeding.

Before committing, follow this workflow:

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to review all uncommitted changes.

2. Verify that the changes are intentional and complete:
   - Ensure no debug code or temporary changes are included.
   - Confirm that documentation in the README and elsewhere has been updated if the changes impact it.
   - Confirm that API spec files (openapi.yaml or openapi.json) have been updated if the changes impact them.
   - Confirm all changes are related and should be in a single commit.
   - If unrelated changes exist, ask whether to commit them separately or together.

3. If you need more context about the work item to write a better commit message, fetch the details:
   - For Jira projects: use the `acli` command line tool. Run `acli jira workitem --help` for usage information.
   - For GitHub projects: use the `gh` command line tool (e.g., `gh issue view <number>`).

4. Create the commit message following the format:
   - Prefix: If an issue or ticket ID is derivable from the branch name (e.g., `PROJECT-123` from `PROJECT-123-feature-description`, or `#42` from `42-fix-login`), prefix the commit message with it (e.g., `[PROJECT-123] ...` or `#42 ...`). If it is not clear whether there is an associated ticket or work item, ask the user whether to include one and what format to use.
   - Description: Clear, professional description of what changed and why.

5. Commit the changes.

6. If the commit fails (pre-commit hooks, validation errors, etc.):
   - Review the error message.
   - Fix any issues raised by hooks or validation.
   - Retry the commit.

If there are no uncommitted changes, report that to the user.
